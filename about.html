        My name is Folasade Adesope, my fans call me Sadebeauty while my close
        pals call me Ayoke. i am a native of Tede, Oyo State.I found this Tech
        career to be an interesting one especially on SheCodes platform. it's a
        challenging step but it,s worth it at the end. lest i forget, i am
        single and fully ready to mingle. If as a tech expert, you don't have a
        partner, it will be exhausting. I like swimmimg but i am still an
        amateur. I love making people uo for their occassions too.I am dark
        skinned and have average height. The most important part of me is that,I
        love to seek knowledge. It's why I am here learning coding. Thanks
