      <p class="about">
        My name is Folasade Adesope, my friends call me Sadebeauty or Ayoke.I am
        a Front-end developer based in Ibadan, Nigeria. I am currently learning
        coding at SheCodes.io. It has been a wonderful experience since the
        first day I started. Matt Delac is a wonderful teacher and instructor,
        he started from the basic and this made it possible for a tech novice to
        understand the workshop. All SheCodes teams are awesome, always
        available to assist. I was able to build a weather App through the
        lessons from SheCodes.
