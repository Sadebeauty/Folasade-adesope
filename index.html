            I am a Front-end developer based in Ibadan, Nigeria. I am currently
            learning coding at SheCodes.io. It has been a wonderful experience
            since the first day I started. Matt Delac is a wonderful teacher and
            instructor, he started from the basic and this made it possible for
            a tech novice to understand the workshop. All SheCodes teams are
            awesome, always available to assist. I was able to build a weather
            App through the lessons from SheCodes.

              <h2>Let's talk about Akara</h2>
              <p>
                Akara is an African cuisine that originated from the Yoruba
                culture, it is made from peeled beans (black-eyed peas), washed
                and ground with pepper, and other preferred seasonings, then
                beaten to aerate them, and deep-fried in small balls. Akara
                plays a significant role in the Yoruba culture, as it is
                specially prepared when a person who has come of age (70 and
                above) dies. It is usually prepared in large quantities and
                distributed across every household close to the deceased. Akara
                also used to be prepared in large as a sign of victory, when
                warriors came back victorious from war. The women, especially
                the wives of the Warriors were to fry Akara and distribute it to
                the villagers. Akara (as it is known in southwest Nigeria) a
                recipe and is a popular breakfast dish, eaten with millet or
                corn pudding. In Nigeria, Akara is commonly eaten with bread,
                akamu ogi (or eko), a type of cornmeal made with fine corn
                flour.
